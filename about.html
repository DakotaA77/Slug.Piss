    <p>My name is Dakota Abercrombie (they/them/theirs). I am a Queer transgender Ojibwe student located in Portland,OR. I am currently enrolled at PSU working towards my Bachelor of Science in Communications. I am minoring in Gender and Sexuality. I value a intersectional and decolonial approach in my works. 
     I decided to create this website to document my works, both writings and art! My hope is this page could work as a mix between a portfolio and a resume, but more fun!</p>
